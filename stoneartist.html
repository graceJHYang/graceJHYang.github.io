            <p>This was a project produced for a university class IAT 344 Moving Images, where we were tasked to create a poetry video along with a short documentary in a team of 4. The film was a collaboration with the Vancouver’s Poet Laureate: Fiona Lam
                and her initiative the City Poems Contest. We chose the award winning poem <em>'the stone artist'</em> by Theresa Rogers.</p>

            <div class="film">

            <h5>Concept</h5>
            <p>
                Initially, the team chose this poem to create a film to interpret the poem literally. However, as we started brainstorming, the timing, location, and weather conditions were not a great fit to showcase the storyline.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we started individually brainstorming, the idea I came up with was to drift away from a literal interpretation and to make it more abstract. I wanted to express the life cycle of the stone artist/art: the stone artist’s artistry that occurs each
                day without being sighted by the people but the nature around it. With additional research, the concept I built was the contrasting lives between the peacefulness of stone artist and the busy everyday life cycle in the city.
            </p>

            <p class="img-cap">Film concept slide</p>

            <p>The storyline expanded to showcase the 2 different worlds: peaceful nature side with the stone artist’s stacking vs. the busy, fast-paced side which ultimately disturbs the nature, knocking down the cairns.</p>

            <h5>Storyboard</h5>
            <p>With the basic storyline in mind, we created a mood board and a storyboard to picture the art direction of our film concept. The storyboard helped map out the scenery we wanted to create alongside the audio.</p>
            <p>To keep the video more abstract, we decided to use sound effects to express the nature and the cityscape instead of including the narration.</p>

            </div>

            <p>The film session spread in a span of 6~7 days.</p>

            <p>During the photoshoot, as the director of photography, I filmed majority of the scenes with the stone artist by the sea and some b-rolls for the cityscape. The film location was set in Stanley Park and the Seawall while the cityscape was filmed
                in Downtown Vancouver.</p>

            <h5>Post Production</h5>
            <p>As one of the main editor and effects artist, I created the baseline for the poetry film using the program Adobe Premiere Pro and Davinci Resolve. The initial process started off with sifting through the footage to select the best shots for
                a smooth flow. Then I worked on colour correcting and added the vintage effect to make the film more nostalgic. Luckily cutting and patching the sequence wasn’t as difficult as we filmed scene by scene and additional b-rolls to fill in
                any holes we may have while editing the scenes.</p>

            <img class="proj-img" src="assets/stoneart/edit_color.png" alt="Editing process">
            <img class="proj-img" src="assets/stoneart/edit_color_1.png" alt="Editing process">
            <img class="proj-img" src="assets/stoneart/edit_color_2.png" alt="Editing process">

            <p>One of the hardships was working on two different programs. The second editor did not have Adobe programs, I struggled to convert the Adobe Premiere Pro file into Davinci Resolve. As the effects feature are completely different, I could not
                convert the effects I created in Premiere. To resolve this issue, I took the chance to rework all of my footage in the new program. In the end I was able to go back and forth combining the clips and getting the final composition exported
                on time.</p>



            <h5>Title Sequence</h5>
            <img class="proj-img" src="assets/stoneart/edit_pt1.png" alt="Title sequence process">
            <p>
                For the introduction of the video, I created a short-animated typography sequence for the title using Adobe After Effects. The initial version was a simple swipe transition with a san-serif font. This effect wasn’t used for the final version as it lacked
                connection between the modern style of the animation compared to the vintage imagery of the film. To bring back the connection, I decided to use a serif font using a particle dissolve effect. I wanted to blend in the title sequence into
                the scene where the title starts to dissolve as the stone artist walks away. The sequence was created using the particle systems and linear wipe feature.

            <h5>Credits</h5>
            <p>
                I created the ending credits for the poetry video where we added an ending sequence along with a poetry reading by the poet Theresa Rogers. The challenge I faced was matching the timing of the caption scrolling to the narrator’s voice. It was several
                trial and error sessions to adjust the position and the speed of the scroll as I was not able to adjust the speed of the narrator’s voice without altering the tone.
            </p>

            <img class="proj-img" src="assets/stoneart/final_edit.png" alt="Credits process">

            <p>To make sure the text is legible on screen, I decided to span the poem across the screen, rolling bottom up as the post-credit scene was playing. Then I had the credits fade in and out to reveal the information at once to meet the time requirement
                of the project and the contest.</p>

            <h5>Reflection</h5>

            <p>I am proud of the outcome of the video and enjoyed learning the process of filming and editing. I was able to improve my leadership skills, organizing and keeping track of the progress while directing the film as I lead the team each day.
                Furthermore, it was one of my first official filming experience and learning to adjust the camera settings to keep each footage similar in colour tone during the shoot each session.</p>
