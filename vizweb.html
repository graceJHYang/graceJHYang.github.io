                and experimentations using type and imagery, we proposed a set of visual artifacts for the event: Pop Art – Fabrics and Fashion.</p>

            <h5>Analysis of Wolfgang Weingart:</h5>
            <p>
                Before designing the graphic assets, we delved into our precedent designer Wolfgang Weingart to find inspiration and a starting point for a set of posters. The team researched into the designer and his works to extract key design qualities and principles
                that will be used for the design explorations. We extracted 5 key qualities and principles:

            <h5>Graphic Experimentation</h5>
            <p>Throughout each of the weeks, we were required to create 3 posters along with graphical assets for each of the posters. Based on the qualities and principles we selected, we created posters that fit each of the categories to explore different
                aspects of our precedent designer.</p>
            <p>As one of the main designers in the team, I heavily contributed in designing each of the graphic assets. The goal within each visual composition was to bring out the pop art essence without falling into the cliché of distinct pop art style
                by applying contemporary features extracted from our secondary precedent designer Raw Color. Each week we experimented our principles to narrow down our options to select one distinct style that had the most potential to be developed into
                a microsite</p>

            <p>From our final selection of posters, we adapted these elements to appeal to the contemporary audience while translating our line of investigation: breaking the parameters of geometric shapes. We did this through the image treatment, overlapping
                shapes and patterns, and fusing image and type together to maintain the iconic pop art essence.</p>

            <p>Initially we created 3 variations to visualize and test which prototype would have the most potential to be developed further as our final product. Based on the design and the user flow, we eded up selecting the middle design as the functional
                design lacked the visual interest to capture the viewers and the more expressive site lacked the familiarity, creating errors and confusion in the flow.</p>

            <h5>Final Direction</h5>
            <p>Based on our explorations of the webflow and initial designs, we decided to go with the second option (my design) which was the expressive option. This design had the most potential and expressed our initial style from the graphical explorations.
                Some of the feedback we received was that this design had a good balance of our earlier explorations and that there were points of interest and the potential to build the micro-interactions.</p>

            <h5>Art Direction</h5>
            <p>I developed the concept based on the event topic and how we wanted to transition the conventional pop art style into a contemporary design. To grab each of these elements, I decided to combine the retro and contemporary together.
            </p>
            <p>To express the bold and exotic feature of pop art, I looked into many colour variations to create a palette that could help express the classic pop art essence but with a contemporary twist. Reminiscent of the bright primary colours in pop
                art, I chose neon colours to bring out the vibrant energy. Each of the colours were chosen to represent the different features of the microsite.</p>

            <h5>Interaction Precedent</h5>
            <p>To further develop the flexibility of our art direction, we focused the interactions towards the use of overlapping shapes and how to transition them. The challenge was to execute the interactions without overwhelming the users with the amount
                of content displayed on each page.

            <h5>Interaction</h5>
            <p>The ultimate goal of our concept was to capture the attention from a glance by using bright neon colours to guide the viewers through the content smoothly. Additionally, we wanted to create a unique transition from one page to another using
                the geometric shaped frames; something simple to convey the information clearly without distraction.</p>

            <h5>Reflection</h5>

            <p>Through these intense 6 weeks, there were many valuable skills I obtained through research and development of the project. With the focus into precedent designers, I was able to have a better understanding of the complexities behind the designer’s
                process and develop my own principles to drive the art direction for each of the graphical assets.</p>
            <p>The project really challenged myself to push for styles I have never tried before and by understanding the process of various designers, I learned to reference the old to develop into a contemporary piece. With weekly deadlines, I was definitely
                able to strengthen converging and diverging design iterations to quickly produce variations for a better final outcome. Overall, this experience helped expand my creativity by exploring different forms and transitioning between graphic
                and digital assets while understanding the research and process of building a visual identity for the microsite.</p>
