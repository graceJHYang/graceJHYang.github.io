            <p>Pak n’go is an application that helps users in the process of packing during a move, whether it’s moving locally or abroad. Offering better interaction through a voting system to help packers justify their kept items, our app proposal aims
                to support groups of 2 or more to apply reasoning of why the items will uphold their envisioned lifestyle.</p>
            <p>This project was completed over 4 weeks for a senior level interaction design class. The goal of the project was to research and design an interactive system for a specific domain and context.</p>

            <div class="ux">
                <h6>Problem Space</h6>
            </div>

            <p>
                Moving can be a stressful and complicated process, whether it’s moving locally or abroad. The process of organizing and packing items to go or minimizing to decrease the load can be time consuming and elusive. With the initial domain of eco-minimalist,
                we focused on the concept of reducing the load to help stay organized while sorting each of the items into keep and discard.
            </p>

            <p>As a quick competitive analysis we looked into existing apps however there were not many apps that supported moving directly but more for keeping a checklist or separating each of the items under a group to remember what items are kept in
                which box.
            </p>

            <div class="ux">
                <h6>Research</h6>
            </div>
            <p>As the initial research, we conducted interviews with 11 stakeholders between 21-67(6 female, 5 male) who had previous experience in moving.</p>
            <p>From our research, we were able to identify key factors that allowed us to better understand how we can develop a better experience of a moving process for people.</p>

            <h5>Insights</h5>
            <p class="li-h5-text-no">Reasons to moving:</p>
            <p>&#x2022; Pursuing work or education opportunities</p>
            <p>&#x2022; Out of necessity such as for financial stability</p>
            <p>&#x2022; Market opportunity to attain a long-term goal of a dream home</p>
            <p>&#x2022; Following family or for new experiences</p>

            <p class="li-h5-text-no">Painpoints:</p>
            <p>&#x2022; Difficulty of knowing what items to keep close and what to pack up</p>
            <p>&#x2022; Tracking personal belongings and other shared items</p>
            <p>&#x2022; Knowing when to start packing, resulting in closing off access</p>
            <p>&#x2022; Knowing what baggage to pack up when alone</p>
            <p>&#x2022; Communicating with others involved in the move</p>

            <h5>Stakeholders</h5>
            <p>We defined our stakeholders based on the collected insights and research strategy.</p>

            <div class=" li-h5-text-flex ">
                <h5 class="li-h5-text-no ">01</h5>
                <p class="li-h5-text "><mark>Individuals:</mark> (Early consideration) How many young people move abroad alone and need a way to organize and track their belongings.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="li-h5-text-flex ">
                <h5 class="li-h5-text-no ">02</h5>
                <p class="li-h5-text "><mark>Duo/Couples:</mark> Many stakeholders nowadays move with roommates or their life partner and require a form of easy communication and decision making for their shared items.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="li-h5-text-flex ">
                <h5 class="li-h5-text-no ">03</h5>
                <p class="li-h5-text "><mark>Groups:</mark> When moving out with multiple individuals, packing and tracking can become difficult and require careful planning along with decision making considering everyone's say.</p>
            </div>

            <p>A persona was developed based off our collected insights and research:</p>

            <p class="img-cap ">Persona developed based on the key insights</p>

            <div class="ux ">
                <h6>Solution</h6>
            </div>

            <p>The concept of the app is to help movers organize and sift through items they require to keep and discard before moving into their new homes. For couples and groups moving in together, we wanted to help them decide on the items they need and
                what items could be left behind.</p>

            <p>We developed a basic user flow to help structure the app before designing the visuals and sketching wireframes to identify and understand the application as a whole. Then we each split off and created the different structures before coming
                together as a whole. I was tasked to create the onboarding pages and the main camera feature. I tried to keep the pages easy to understand and instinctual to avoid any confusion.</p>

            <div class="ux ">
                <h6>Deliverable</h6>
            </div>
            <h5>Visual design:</h5>
            <p>We decided to use neutral tones to keep the application clean and highlight interactive features with a brighter colour to help stand out. Furthermore, we believed using minimal amount of colour with white space helps components stand out
                more and bring balance to the overall design.</p>

            <p class="img-cap ">Initial Wireframes of the application features</p>
            <p>Initially we created a set of wireframes to quickly visualize the interactions and workflows. Then we developed each of the features and focused on how we could design the layouts without overwhelming the users with text on each of the display.
                I worked on developing the camera feature along with the gallery space to display the items. I focused on keeping the layout familiar by referencing the smartphone camera display and incorporate the settings for the keep and discard feature.</p>

                <h6>User Test</h6>
            </div>

            <p>Before moving onto our final design, we conducted user testing with 10 stakeholders to gather insights and feedback on the core workflow of our application. We observed the users to visualize how they react and work through the application.
                Additionally, we interviewed the users to hear any concerns or thoughts on how we could better their experience with our designs.</p>

            <div class=" li-h5-text-flex ">
                <h5 class="li-h5-text-no ">01</h5>
                <p class="li-h5-text "><mark>Irrelevant Feature:</mark></p>
            </div>
            <p>Users felt the onboarding was too long and some of the information was not as important. Users wanted to get into the app quicker. The initial feature of boxing items after capturing them seemed unnecessary as it could be don’t physically.</p>

            <div class="li-h5-text-flex ">
                <h5 class="li-h5-text-no ">02</h5>
                <p class="li-h5-text "><mark>Confusing Feature:</mark></p>
            </div>
            <p>The group creation feature was confusing mixed in with the individual options.</p>

            <div class="li-h5-text-flex ">
                <h5 class="li-h5-text-no ">03</h5>
                <p class="li-h5-text "><mark>Non-instinctual:</mark></p>
            </div>
            <p>With unclear labelling, users did not know what the buttons were meant to do and it confused the overall workflow. Furthermore, the customized camera settings were not clear enough to guide the users losing the instinctual flow.</p>

            <p>To begin simplifying our application we narrowed the onboarding process, removed the individual usage option (directing the app to 2+ group usage only) and focused solely on the item selection feature.</p>

            </div>

            <h5>Reflection</h5>
            <p>From this project, I was able to learn the process of creating an application from scratch and how important it is to conduct user research and user testing. These steps helped the team understand how the user understands the workflow of the
                app and how we as designers can help resolve the users’ frustrations and create a positive experience. I am proud of the result as we struggled to land a specific domain without getting lost in the topics that have already been overdeveloped.
            </p>

            <p>In addition, if I had the opportunity, I would like to implement an additional element to the app. A feature to help connect the users for donation or recyclable items and providing opportunities to reduce waste and find options to provide
                home appliances and used items a new home. For example, upgrading the camera feature to allow scanning the items to see how the items can be recycled or reused.
